# NodeStreamingService

Aim of this project is to create a simplified version of streaming service like Netflix or Youtube. It should present a number of videos (as thumbnails with basic info) and stream a chosen video with HTML5 Video Player

App assumes that data and files in assets folder are managed and synchronised by external source (like a CMS). It it possible to go through the assets folder, fetch data and generate thumbnails during generating HTTP responses but I find it not optimal.

App FE is very simplified due to the fact that the aim of this project was to play with NodeJS.
